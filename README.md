In my implementation of the project, I used React with Redux for global state management. I used Ant Design as my design framework (although, Polaris is great!). I've added several additional features, such as saving the nominations to localStorage, a drag-and-drop nominations menu to allow the user to sort their nominations (1 through 5), and detailed alert notifications and modals.
